# facematch
Code for my youtube video called Facematch, where I used Face recognition model to filterout my images out of 3000+ images.

- main.py used for face matching (the only thing you should focus on ;)
- preview.py used for previewing images (for testing specially).
- emojify.py used for hiding privacy of the people.

Feel free to modify the script based on your usecase.
